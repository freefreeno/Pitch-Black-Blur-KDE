# Pitch-Black-Blur-KDE

## Pitch Black Blurred Plasma is a full KDE Plasma theme. It has aurorae,Plasma,look-and-feel,konsole and gtk theme all that match perfectly. 

## The best icons are the Newaita icons. They can be found here: https://store.kde.org/p/1243493 

## I use the Force Blur kwin script and itcan be found here: https://store.kde.org/p/1294604

I left the view background lighter on this theme because I just can't see things really well when you have it too dark so this theme is dark in the correct places I guess you could say. It is a really nice and well thought theme. I make themes for people who actually use there PC to work and not for transparency. Screenshots never can do a theme justice. Either it looks good on screenshots and terrible on you PC or the other way around and that is why I always reccomend to just install at least the colors and see if you like those first. I hope you like this one and please download from the KDE store and give me your opinion.
